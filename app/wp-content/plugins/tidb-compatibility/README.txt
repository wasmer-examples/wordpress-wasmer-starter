This plugin is an official tool provided by PingCAP, designed to solve compatibility issues between TiDB and WordPress.

== Description ==

TiDB is a high-performance database that is compatible with the MySQL protocol. Since MySQL has deprecated the SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS function, TiDB also has no intention of offering the SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS function. This leads to an error in WordPress when using TiDB, indicating that SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS is not supported, and submissions cannot be displayed correctly.

WordPress is also currently working on this issue, but it seems that more time is needed. #47280 Remove usage of deprecated MySQL SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS from WP_Query

This plugin solves the issue of TiDB not providing the SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS function. Once this plugin is activated, parts of WP_Query that use SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS will be replaced with the COUNT(*) function.

This plugin is entirely based on the method mentioned by @akramipro in the article, and this solution works perfectly and addresses the issue. I've turned this method into a plugin so that those using TiDB can easily resolve this problem. Many thanks to @akramipro for the excellent work, and I hope the official WordPress team can address this issue sooner.
